## Introduction
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source library that includes computer vision and image processing tools.  
This project performs:
1. **Image Loading**: Reading an image file using `imread()`.
2. **Edge Detection**: Applying the Canny edge detection algorithm to identify edges in the image.

---

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following installed:
- **macOS (M1/M2)** or any compatible OS
- **OpenCV** (version 4.x+)
- **C++ Compiler** (e.g., `clang++` or `g++`)

---







## Installations & Run code
 ```
brew install opencv
pkg-config --modversion opencv4
git clone https://github.com/agneya_1402/Cpp-Computer-Vision
./edge_detection
```



Code Explanation
The project consists of a two files: edge_detection.cpp & img_load.cpp

The original and edge-detected images are displayed using imshow().

## How to Run
Compile the Program: Use clang++ or g++ to compile:



## Example

1. Input Image:

2. Edge-Detected Image: ![Output](https://github.com/agneya-1402/C-Computer-Vision/blob/main/%20.png)
